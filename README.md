# Bluetooth-Speaker
A fully function Bluetooth Speaker implement most of the new ICs chip. The design consists of four PCBs and 3 microcontrollers. I build and test all the PCBs and they work as expected so the hardware design is done. However, the software part is still under process. Please refer to the zip file for more information about specific PCBs. I have also included any software needed to program the microcontrollers.
