# Bluetooth-Speaker

A fully function Bluetooth Speaker implement most of the new ICs chip.

The design consists of four PCBs and 3 microcontrollers. I build and test all the PCBs and they work as expected so the hardware design is done. **However, the software part is still under process.**

Please refer to the shared files for more information about specific PCB. I have also included any software needed to program the microcontrollers.
