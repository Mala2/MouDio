You can use any Acrylic you would like, but in this case I wanted to hide the LEDs from direct view. The manfucture **Tap PlasticsÂ®** has a cool way to accomplish that by applying a unique Acrylic created for this reason.

By using the below **Chemcast Black LED Acrylic** all the LEDs will be hidden away inside and only let the light to glow through. In the other hand it will apear opaque once the LEDs are off
