# TAS5825M OR TAS5825P

It is a class D amplifier with 90 mΩ RDS. It can output 2 × 30 W, at 24V on 8Ω driver load.

I initially intended to use **TAS5825M** but I found out that **TAS5825P** has Hybrid Pro algorithm to extend the battery life by more than 50% and it is pin-pin compatible with **TAS5825M**.


The [*FSC-BT806 Feasycom*](https://github.com/Mala2/FSC-BT806) can output analog which can be fed to the ADC **PCM1820** PCB to output 32-bits, 2-channel I2S/TDM then that can be fed to amplifier **[TAS5825M](/Prototype/AMP_TAS5825M/)** PCB. Also,The [*FSC-BT806 Feasycom*](https://github.com/Mala2/FSC-BT806) can output 2-channel I2S to directly connect to **[TAS5825M](/Prototype/AMP_TAS5825M/)** PCB if that desirable.

Power Supply
